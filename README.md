If you asked me last week to tell you when I bought this guitar, I would have said 2010, maybe even 2011.

This week I wrote down the serial number from inside the guitar and went on the Web to see what I could find.

Yamaha is very good about serial numbers corresponding to production dates, and it turns out that my Yamaha FG403S acoustic guitar was made in Taiwan on Dec. 5, 2003.

2003?? So when did I buy it?

I started looking for receipts, and this time it didn't take more than five minutes for me to find an envelope marked "Yamaha FG403S." Inside was a receipt from Guitar Center in Sherman Oaks.

I purchased the guitar for $199.99 and spent another $19.99 for a gig bag on Feb. 28, 2004.

I had thought the guitar was 10 years old, but it was really 17 years old as of late 2020.

The reason I bought the guitar was that I wanted an instrument I could throw in the back of my trunk, take to work and not worry about. I could play a little bit during my work day, and if the guitar fell apart, it would be no big loss.

My original intention was to get a $99 guitar with a laminated top. At the time, I was intent on playing jazz, and even if I could swing (so to speak) a $3,000 Gibson acoustic archtop, I definitely wouldn't be lugging it around in the back of my 2001 Ford Focus (which I had until late 2015, by the way — great car).

I had never owned a steel-string acoustic guitar before. Once I started shopping, I learned that acoustic guitars with solid tops sounded better, and these models didn't cost that much more than those with laminated tops.

Guitar Center was listing this guitar in their ads for $199.99, and I eventually went down to the store, played a bunch of guitars and bought this one. They don't give you the floor model. Instead they get you an unplayed guitar in the box. They unpacked it and put it in the gig bag, and I took it home.

This Yamaha FG403S is very well made. Fit and finish is pretty much perfect. There's a little bit of glue and some kind of mesh visible on the brace near the bottom of the soundhole, but otherwise it's a very well-built guitar. I haven't played it all that much, and it looks as good 17 years later as the day I bought it.

The guitar was (and is) so nice I couldn't justify throwing it in the trunk and leaving it there, so my plan for a throwaway travel guitar didn't really work out. Instead, I have a pretty nice flattop guitar (my first).

The Yamaha is a fairly standard dreadnought guitar with a 25.5-inch scale — the same as Fender electric guitars. It shipped with medium-light (.012 high E) phosphor bronze strings, which I left on the guitar for many years, it turns out.

A couple of years ago, I started playing the guitar again, and I bought a set of Ernie Ball Earthwood Medium (.013 high E) 80/20 Bronze strings. I thought the thicker strings would mimic what I have on my Gibson ES-175. It was my first time changing strings on a flattop, and I used the bridge-pin puller on the plastic string winder I bought when I was around 9 or 10 years old; I've had that thing a long time. Only one bridge pin shot out and hit the ceiling. I learned something that day about bridge pins.

Once I had the medium-gauge strings on the Yamaha, the action got very high. I had to find the proper hex wrench and crank the truss rod many times to even out the neck. I did get it right eventually.

I changed the strings again about a month ago. The low E string was sounding kind of dead. This time I went for Ernie Ball Earthwood Medium-Light (.012) 80/20 Bronze strings. I've been going "lighter" on all my guitars (Classical, solidbody, archtop) and wanted to do the same with the flattop.

The new strings sound great. Very piano-like in their attack. The low E is much better. I think there's something about the guitar's build that "constricts" the sound of the low E string. It's not quite a wolf-tone situation, but I get the feeling that the bracing is keeping the string and the notes on the first five frets from vibrating the top too much.
