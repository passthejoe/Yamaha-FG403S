If you asked me last week to tell you when I bought this guitar, I would have said 2010, maybe even 2011.

This week I wrote down the serial number from inside the guitar and went on the Web to see what I could find.

Yamaha is very good about serial numbers corresponding to production dates, and it turns out that my Yamaha FG403S acoustic guitar was made in Taiwan on Dec. 5, 2003.

2003?? So when did I buy it?

I started looking for receipts, and this time it didn't take more than five minutes for me to find an envelope marked "Yamaha FG403S." Inside was a receipt from Guitar Center in Sherman Oaks.

I purchased the guitar for $199.99 and spent another $19.99 for a gig bag on Feb. 28, 2004.

I had thought the gutar was 10 years old but it's really 17 years old as of late 2020.

The reason I bought the guitar was that I wanted an instrument I could throw in the back of my trunk, take to work and not worry about. I could play a little bit during my work day, and if the guitar fell apart, it would be no big loss.

My original intention was to get a $99 guitar with a laminated top. At the time, I was intent on playing jazz, and even if I could swing (so to speak) a $3,000 Gibson acoustic archtop, I definitely wouldn't be lugging it around in the back of my 2001 Ford Focus (which I had until late 2015, by the way â€” great car).

I had never owned a steel-string acoustic guitar before. Once I started shopping.
